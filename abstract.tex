Objective: To evaluate whether or not Clojure Spec meets the goals it
sets out to meet with regards to easy data validation, performance in
doing so and automatically generated tests in comparison to existing
specification systems in the Clojure ecosystem.

Method: We implemented a specification for a real-world data format in
the three currently popular specification systems used in Clojure and
compared their merits in terms of code size, performance and auxiliary
benefits.

Results: Spec shines with complex data, both in how its expressed in
code and validation performance, but has an API more complex than its
competitors.

Conclusions: Depending on the use case and exactly what the need is Spec
and other libraries like it can be recommended.
